Lamingtons are little sponge cakes coated in chocolate and grated coconut.
A traditional Australian treat that appeals to most.
Any firm type of plain cake can be used: butter cake, pound cake, Madeira cake or genoise sponge. 
Note: desiccated coconut is a slightly dried shredded coconut--not sweetened.
